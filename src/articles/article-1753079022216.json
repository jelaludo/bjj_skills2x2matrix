  "content": "Coaching Advice for Grappling Athletes: Wrestling, Judo, and BJJ Grappling sports like wrestling, judo, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) share many core principles, yet each has unique nuances in training and competition. This comprehensive analysis compiles coaching advice from peer-reviewed sports science research , respected coaching manuals , and community discussions (e.g. Reddit forums and social media), organized into clear categories. We cover general athletic preparation, grappling-specific technical tips, discipline-specific strategies, and mental/tactical advice. Throughout, we highlight common themes – such as the emphasis on fundamentals and conditioning – and note differences between disciplines or sources. All scientific claims are backed by evidence, and practical insights from experienced coaches and athletes are included for actionable guidance. General Athletic Preparation (Strength, Conditioning, Nutrition, Recovery) Strength & Power Training: All grappling disciplines recognize the importance of building functional strength. Improved muscular strength and power enhance an athlete’s ability to finish takedowns, execute throws, and dominate positions . For example, elite BJJ players show high levels of strength and anaerobic power, correlating with success on the mat . Modern judo and wrestling programs incorporate weightlifting (squats, deadlifts, presses, pulls) and explosive exercises (Olympic lifts, plyometrics) to increase grip strength, hip drive, and overall explosiveness . As a judo article notes, what was once a “nice-to-have” is now essential – strength training, when done in balance, complements technique rather than undermining it . Stronger grapplers can impose their game more easily, assuming skill levels are equal . Notably, grip strength is a specific asset: judo and BJJ athletes benefit from exercises like towel pull-ups or farmer’s carries to develop forearm and hand endurance for gripping the gi or an opponent’s limbs . Coaches do caution that strength should never replace technique , but rather provide a higher potential for applying technical moves . Conditioning & Endurance: Grappling matches are brutally demanding on the cardiovascular system. Unlike steady-state endurance sports, grappling is intermittent – bursts of explosive activity punctuated by short rest or slower exchanges . All three disciplines require a mix of aerobic endurance (to sustain effort over multiple minutes or multiple matches) and anaerobic conditioning (for intense scrambles and power moves). Sports science reviews show BJJ athletes have VO₂max values similar to other grapplers (~42–52 ml/kg/min) , indicating solid aerobic fitness, while wrestling is noted to rely even more on anaerobic power due to its short match length (often 6 minutes or less) . Coaches advise incorporating high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and sport-specific conditioning drills to mimic match demands . For instance, wrestlers often do “shark tank” rounds (fresh partners cycling in) to push their anaerobic threshold, and judokas practice consecutive throw drills to build stamina. Work capacity – the ability to grapple hard for the whole match and through a day of tournament bouts – is a major differentiator at advanced levels • 1 2 3 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 • 13 14 15 16 17 2 18 1 \n\n. As legendary wrestling coach Dan Gable put it, conditioning can win matches: “The 2nd period is won by the kid in the best shape.” In practice, this means grapplers must do roadwork (running, swimming, etc.), circuits, and lots of sparring to develop a deep gas tank. Both aerobic endurance (for recovery and sustained effort) and muscular endurance (ability to perform repeated grips, shots, or escapes without fatigue) should be targeted . Effective conditioning also reduces injury risk from exhaustion and allows athletes to maintain mental clarity under stress. Flexibility and Mobility: Grappling pushes joints through extreme ranges, so flexibility is highly valued. High-level grapplers tend to have above-average flexibility – one review noted experienced BJJ athletes were more flexible than novices . Flexibility in the hips, shoulders, and core can improve guard work in BJJ, help escape tight pins in wrestling, and allow judoka to enter throws more deeply. Coaches include dynamic stretching, mobility drills , and yoga/gymnastics elements in training to enhance range of motion and prevent injuries . Common focus areas are hip mobility (for guard retention and wrestling sprawls), hamstrings and lower back (for takedown posture and inversion in BJJ), and shoulder mobility (for posting, posting and rolling out of throws, etc.). For example, BJJ instructors often start class with hip escape (shrimp) and bridge drills – these not only ingrain movements but also keep the body limber. Judo coaches drill ukemi (breakfalling) which inherently improves flexibility and rolling ability. Adequate flexibility also contributes to injury prevention : a limber athlete is less likely to pull a muscle during an awkward scramble. It’s worth noting that mobility (active range of motion and control) is prioritized over mere static flexibility – grapplers benefit from being able to move fluidly into positions. Stretching routines and proper warm-ups (discussed more under recovery) are an entrenched part of grappling practice for this reason. Nutrition and Weight Management: Grappling is typically divided into weight classes, so nutrition is critical not just for performance but also for making weight. General advice is for grapplers to consume a balanced diet with ample lean protein (for muscle repair), quality carbohydrates (for fueling high-intensity efforts), and fruits/vegetables for micronutrients . In practice, many athletes periodize their diet: eating higher carbs in heavy training periods and adjusting intake when tapering or cutting weight. Weight cutting deserves special mention in wrestling, judo, and BJJ competitions. Traditional wrestling culture involved severe dehydration and fasting to shed pounds before weigh-ins, but modern coaching strongly emphasizes safer approaches . Experts recommend gradual weight loss in the weeks prior – through a slight calorie deficit and increased exercise – rather than drastic last-minute dehydrating . A sports physiologist in an ESPN feature advises bringing down weight slowly (e.g. ~0.2–0.3 kg per day) by reducing carbs and sodium, while maintaining training intensity, so that only 1–2 kg are left to sweat out the day before competition . This prevents excessive performance decline. After weigh-in, proper rehydration and refueling are crucial; coaches often have wrestlers and judoka rehydrate with electrolyte drinks and eat easily digestible, high-carb meals to replenish energy. In BJJ, day-before weigh-ins (in some events) allow more recovery, but same-day weigh-ins (common in judo and wrestling) require smarter cutting and rehydration strategies. Overall, the consensus is: diet is part of an athlete’s training. Many grappling gyms now provide nutritional guidance, teaching athletes to avoid junk weight cuts, to not drop weight at the expense of strength, and to always train and compete well- fueled. In short: you can’t out-train a poor diet . Consistently eating enough protein, staying hydrated, and consuming sufficient carbs for training are seen as the basics of grappler nutrition . 14 19 20 19 21 • 22 23 24 • 25 26 27 28 27 27 29 30 31 2 \n\nRecovery, Rest, and Injury Prevention: High-level training is only effective if balanced with recovery . Grappling takes a toll on the body – muscle soreness, joint strain, and the occasional minor injury are common. Coaches therefore stress that rest is as important as training . A sports performance article specifically on BJJ notes that rest and recovery are “essential parts” of training that many people neglect . Adequate recovery allows athletes to train more often and with higher quality, whereas neglecting it can lead to overtraining, burnout, or injury . Key recovery practices include sleep (aiming for 7–9 hours for hard-training athletes), proper nutrition and hydration (which aid muscle repair), and scheduling rest days or light days. Staying hydrated and maintaining electrolyte balance, for instance, helps prevent cramps and improve next-day performance . Some grapplers use modern techniques like foam rolling, sports massage, or contrast showers, but the fundamentals remain sleep and diet. Coaches often program light technical sessions or active recovery (e.g. swimming, mobility work) in between intense sparring days. Injury prevention protocols are also integrated. A recent evidence-based review proposed a structured injury-prevention warm-up for grappling sports to address common injury patterns . For example, since takedowns and throws are a leading cause of injuries, a warm-up might include tumbling drills, dynamic stretching, and sport-specific movements to prepare the body . Research shows that a proper warm-up can significantly reduce injury incidence in grapplers . Many clubs follow something akin to the FIFA 11+ (a soccer injury prevention program) but adapted for grappling – including neck exercises (to prevent cervical injuries), shoulder stability work, and hip/ankle mobility drills. Additionally, strength training itself is protective: stronger muscles and tendons help cushion joints. As noted in a judo strength guide, resistance training is “the number one thing you can do to avoid injuries” – it fortifies the body against the stresses of throws and grappling impacts . Another aspect of prevention is listening to one’s body: athletes are encouraged to communicate with coaches about fatigue or pain and to take deload weeks as needed. Consistent recovery practices (good sleep hygiene, proper warm-ups/cool-downs, and not pushing through serious pain) can extend an athlete’s longevity on the mats. Ultimately, the goal is to train hard and train long – a balance of intensity and recovery yields the best results. Consistency and Training Habits: A broad piece of general advice across all sources is to train consistently . There is no substitute for mat time; regular practice ingrains skills and builds conditioning that sporadic training cannot. Coaches often prefer an athlete who trains moderate amounts year-round over one who oscillates between boot-camp intensity and long breaks. For beginners, a common recommendation is attending 2–3 classes per week minimum to see steady progress . One BJJ coaching article bluntly states: “Consistent training is essential – steady attendance and repetition will help you internalize techniques more effectively” . This holds true in wrestling and judo as well. That said, consistency also means finding a sustainable routine – it’s better to start at a manageable frequency and ramp up than to burn out after an initial surge. Elite grapplers eventually often train daily (sometimes twice a day), but they build up to that level. Consistency applies not just to showing up, but also to effort: bringing focus and intent to each practice. Drilling a move hundreds of times over weeks is what sharpens technique for competition. Consistency in conditioning (maintaining off-season fitness) and in diet (year-round healthy eating, not just pre-tournament) also sets top athletes apart. A wrestler’s maxim is “summer wrestling makes winter champions,” underscoring that those who train when others take off will have an edge. In summary, general athletic preparation for grappling sports means being a well-rounded athlete – strong, conditioned, flexible – with good habits that support continuous improvement. The common theme is preparation: the better you prepare your body, the more effectively you can apply technique and strategy in live grappling. • 32 32 33 34 35 36 35 36 37 38 • 39 40 40 3 \n\nTechnical Skills and Drills in Grappling (Technique, Position, Drilling) Master the Fundamentals First: A universal coaching theme is to focus on fundamental techniques and positions before chasing high-difficulty moves. In BJJ, for example, beginners are urged to master basic escapes, positional controls, and high-percentage submissions (armbars, triangle chokes, etc.) before attempting flashy techniques . A reputable BJJ curriculum (Saulo Ribeiro’s, for instance) prioritizes survival and escapes for white belts, solid guard passing and sweeps for blue belts, and so on – building a pyramid of skills. The reason is simple: advanced moves only work if set up by solid basics . This holds true in wrestling and judo as well. Double-leg takedowns, single-legs, hip throws, and positional pins are fundamentals that athletes drill relentlessly. Interestingly, even at elite levels, matches are often won with “basic” moves executed extremely well. An experienced wrestling coach points out that in the Olympic finals, the deciding scores might come from a double-leg takedown or a simple go-behind – techniques learned in one’s first year of wrestling . The highest achievers have “ brilliance with the basics ” . This principle is echoed in judo: the most successful competitors typically specialize in a couple of throws (uchimata, seoi-nage, etc.) and do them masterfully. Coaches often say “ don’t fear the man who knows 1000 techniques; fear the man who has practiced one technique 1000 times .” Thus, practice time is devoted heavily to fundamental drills – e.g., pummeling for underhooks in wrestling, grip fighting in judo, hip escape and guard retention drills in BJJ. Strong fundamentals also make you coachable – athletes with sound basics can absorb advanced strategies later, whereas those with flashy but shaky fundamentals hit a ceiling. Across grappling sports, the advice is clear: build a strong foundation . (Or as many BJJ gyms post on their walls: “Basics > fancy moves.”) Technique and Leverage Over Strength: Grappling is often described as “physical chess” – strategy and technique can trump brute force. A common reminder from coaches is that leverage, body mechanics, and timing create efficiency. Renzo Gracie and John Danaher famously said: “Reduced to its core, jiu-jitsu is the employment of intelligence and skill to overcome brute strength and aggression.” In practice, this means using an opponent’s force against them and applying techniques with proper mechanics so that even a smaller person can prevail. For example, dropping levels and using one’s legs and hips (the strongest muscles) is far more effective for a takedown than muscling with the arms. Judo’s principle of “maximum efficiency, minimum effort” (Seiryoku Zen’yō) encapsulates this – you off-balance the opponent (kuzushi) and use momentum to throw, instead of pure lifting. In BJJ, new students learn that positioning and technique enable a smaller grappler to choke a larger one by targeting weak points like the neck or joint locks applied with the whole body. Coaches will often have stronger athletes roll with strict technique (avoiding strength-based escapes) to instill this habit. A concrete example of technique > strength is the concept “position before submission.” This classic BJJ adage reminds grapplers to secure a dominant position and proper control before hunting for a finish . If one hastily jumps on a submission without position, a savvy opponent will escape or counter. By prioritizing positional control (like achieving mount or back control), you both tire out your opponent and reduce their escape options when you do attempt the submission . Similarly, a wrestler focuses on breaking an opponent’s posture and hips down before trying to turn them for a pin. In judo, judoka set up throws by gripping and off-balancing first rather than trying to lift an opponent outright. The technical advice across disciplines is to use leverage points – e.g., underhooks, lapel grips, posting on the mat – to multiply force. As one BJJ instructor put it, “BJJ is a sport that emphasizes technique and leverage over brute strength” . Strength and speed help, but they are icing on the cake; the cake is sound technique. This theme is • 41 42 43 42 • 44 45 46 47 4 \n\nreinforced in training by drilling with progressive resistance: start moves smoothly, get the mechanics right, then add resistance to ensure you’re not resorting to sheer strength. In summary, grapplers are coached to be smart fighters : apply physics and strategy, not just athletics. Drill, Drill, Drill (Repetition): Repetition is the mother of skill in grappling. A common piece of advice is “drillers make killers,” meaning the more you rehearse a technique, the more instinctive and effective it becomes. Practice includes isolated drilling (repeating a move in a cooperative setting) and positional sparring (live practice from set positions), in addition to regular sparring. Scientific understanding of motor learning supports this: high repetitions build muscle memory so that techniques can be executed under pressure with minimal conscious thought . For example, judo players do uchikomi (entry drills) hundreds of times per session – this ingrains the feel of proper entry for throws. BJJ classes often include drilling a sweep or submission 10–20 times each side with a compliant partner before live rolling. A competition-focused BJJ guide emphasizes “repetition is paramount to mastery” – suggesting ample time dedicated to drilling one’s A-game techniques to instinctively hit them in a tournament . Wrestling coaches run stance-and-motion and penetration-shot drills daily, so that a wrestler’s shots are fast and well-timed. The key is consistent, quality reps : sloppy drilling is discouraged, as it can ingrain bad habits. Instead, athletes are taught to practice perfectly , then gradually add speed and intensity. Positional sparring is another invaluable drill method – e.g., starting every roll from guard, or having one person start on the other’s back – to funnel practice into areas that need work. This kind of specific training accelerates learning by increasing repetitions of those scenarios. On forums like Reddit, experienced grapplers often advise newcomers to allocate part of open-mat time to drilling what they learned that week, not just free-rolling. The benefit of repetition was also highlighted in the mental preparation context: by drilling a technique thousands of times, you gain confidence that you can execute it when exhausted or stressed . To keep drills from becoming stale, coaches use variations – for instance, situational drills with moderate resistance, or “flow rolling” where partners go back-and-forth with techniques. But the bottom line remains: time on task . If you want a great double-leg, you might do tens of thousands of shots in your career. Consistent drilling builds the neural pathways and reflexes that distinguish an expert from a novice. Positional Strategy and Grappling IQ: Grappling isn’t just about moves in isolation – it’s about how you transition and maintain advantageous positions . Thus, coaching emphasizes understanding positional hierarchies and strategies. In BJJ, this means learning the importance of dominant positions (back mount, mount, side control) and how to progress through them (guard -> pass -> side control -> mount -> back, etc.). The mantra “position before submission” (mentioned above) highlights strategy: you accumulate positional advantage which both scores points (in sport BJJ) and increases threat. For wrestlers, position often refers to stance and balance – e.g. staying low, with head up and hips under you, so you don’t get taken down. A wrestler with good position is hard to move or score on. Wrestlers are coached to “maintain good position” even during attacks – meaning no reckless shots that put you under your opponent, and no exposure of your back. In judo, kuzushi (off-balancing) is a positional concept – you create an angle or unsteady stance in your opponent before executing a throw. One Reddit judoka advised a beginner: “Don’t worry about throwing at first; get your grips, maintain good posture and balance, and just move your partner around the mat… upsetting their balance without using excessive force” . This drill teaches feeling an opponent’s balance – a positional skill – rather than blindly attacking. Grappling “IQ” involves knowing where on the body to control the opponent. For instance, controlling the hips is paramount in wrestling (to prevent your opponent from standing or bridging out) and likewise in BJJ (pinning the • 48 48 48 • 49 50 5 \n\nhips can kill an opponent’s escape attempts). In BJJ, a concept of “frames and pressure” is taught: use your limbs as frames to maintain distance or pressure to hold someone down. These are positional skills that enable smaller grapplers to neutralize bigger ones by aligning force through skeletal structures instead of muscle. Coaches also teach transitions : how to move fluidly from one position to the next best position. An example is chain passing in BJJ – if a guard pass is blocked, immediately transition to a different pass or backstep to another position, rather than stopping. In wrestling, this is chain wrestling : if a single-leg is defended, transition to a double or a front headlock spin-behind. Practitioners are encouraged to always think two steps ahead – if the opponent counters your move, know the follow-up. This creates a strategical flow where you stay one move ahead. Position also ties into point strategy in sport contexts: a wrestler near the edge of the mat will circle in to avoid giving up position or a push-out point; a BJJ athlete ahead on points might play safe in a dominant position rather than risk losing it. Good coaching covers these tactical aspects: e.g., “If you’re up on points with 30 seconds, keep a solid side control and don’t give space.” In sum, beyond individual techniques, grapplers are taught a positional framework : how to systematically advance position, deny the opponent their position, and capitalize on transitions. This positional understanding often separates intermediate grapplers from beginners. It’s often said that a black belt in BJJ is just a white belt who excelled at the fundamentals and never quit – meaning they have superior basics and positional understanding. Specific Training Methods: Grappling coaching employs a variety of training methods to build technical skill. Aside from standard drilling and sparring, some notable methods include: Situational/Positional Sparring: As mentioned, starting sparring from set positions (e.g., start with one person in mount, or start with double sleeve grips in guard for BJJ, or start in over-under clinch for Greco wrestling). This method targets specific skills (escaping mount, executing armbar from guard, finishing a single-leg, etc.) and ensures even rarely encountered positions get practiced. It’s a controlled way to get repetitions under realistic resistance in those scenarios. Isolation Sparring: Similar to positional sparring, but even more restricted – for example, in BJJ “grip fighting only” rounds where the goal is just to establish dominant grips for takedowns without completing the takedown, or in judo “uchikomi with light resistance” rounds, or wrestling hand- fighting practice where no shots are allowed initially. These isolate one aspect of the fight to focus improvement. Flow Rolling / Technical Sparring: Especially in BJJ, flow rolling is sparring at ~50% intensity where both partners move through techniques in a continuous exchange without fully resisting. This builds timing and creativity, and allows practice of new moves in a low-risk setting. Judo has something similar called yakusoku-geiko (pre-arranged sparring) where each judoka takes turns attacking and defending throws in a flowing manner. Drilling with Resistance: Once a technique is learned, coaches may have students drill it with progressive resistance – e.g., your partner gives 20% resistance, then 50%, so you learn to adjust when it’s not perfect. Eventually this blends into full sparring. An example is practicing a triangle choke where the partner occasionally tries to posture up, and the attacker learns to adjust their angle – a live element to drilling. Combination Drills: In wrestling and judo especially, combination techniques are drilled. For instance, a wrestler might drill a high-crotch takedown immediately transitioning to a double-leg finish if the opponent defends – repeating that combo as one sequence. Judoka drill renraku-waza (combos) like ouchi gari (inside trip) to kouchi gari (small inside trip) to finish a resisting opponent. This builds instinct for chaining moves when the first attempt is foiled. • • • • • • 6 \n\nTimed Drill Circuits: Some coaches set up stations – e.g., 2 minutes of throw entries, then 2 minutes of guard retention drill, then 2 minutes of shots sprawls, rotating partners. This keeps training intense and varied, almost like HIIT for technique. Visualization/Walk-throughs: Not a physical drill per se, but coaches sometimes have athletes walk through their game plan techniques slowly or even just visualize them. For example, shadow- wrestling (like shadow-boxing) is used to practice level changes and shots solo. Mental rehearsal of techniques can supplement physical reps, especially when resting or if injured. The above methods are used to keep training efficient and focused . Rather than just doing 10 rounds of free sparring (which has its place for conditioning and broad skill application), targeted drills ensure specific techniques get enough attention. One community insight from BJJ is that hobbyist practitioners with limited training time benefit greatly from dedicating part of each session to drilling key moves, as opposed to only rolling – it accelerates technical progress. Specificity is also key: for example, grapplers who compete in no-gi BJJ will include more wrestling-style takedown drills and gripping drills without the gi, whereas gi practitioners will spend time on collar and sleeve grip fighting. Coaches align drills with the competition rules and common scenarios of their discipline (e.g., judo newaza drills are short and explosive because in judo competition you get only a brief time on the ground to secure a pin or submission). In summary, effective technical training in grappling is structured : a blend of repetitive drilling, controlled situation sparring, and live sparring, all geared toward developing a game that will hold up under pressure. Safety and Technique Execution: Technical advice also includes how to train safely and correctly. Grappling involves potentially dangerous moves (joint locks, high-amplitude throws), so coaches instill safety protocols. Tapping is one – in BJJ (and judo submissions), the rule is “tap early, tap often” to avoid injury and learn in the process . Beginners might be reminded constantly to swallow their ego and tap if caught in an armbar or choke, since injuries will only set back progress. Likewise, when applying submissions in training, good gyms enforce controlled application – apply slowly and with control , give your partner a chance to tap. In wrestling and judo, proper falling technique (ukemi) is emphasized from day one to prevent injuries when thrown. A new judoka spends a lot of time learning to breakfall in all directions. This not only prevents injury (e.g., reducing risk of concussion or shoulder injury from a throw) but also increases confidence – if you aren’t afraid of being thrown, you will spar more freely. Coaches also teach proper posture and alignment to execute techniques efficiently. For example, on a double-leg takedown: keep your back straight, head up, and step in with good posture to avoid neck injuries and maximize power. In judo throws, locking your core and lifting with the legs prevents back injuries. Many injuries in grappling happen when technique breaks down under fatigue, so drilling good form is a preventative measure. Another aspect of safety is training etiquette : e.g., in BJJ, don’t yank on someone’s neck cranking a guillotine; in wrestling, don’t slam practice partners; in judo randori, take care of your partner by not finishing a throw in a way that injures. Good coaches foster a culture of looking out for each other’s well-being. As a result, students develop trust and can train harder knowing their partners will release submissions or not intentionally hurt them. In summary, technical excellence and safety go hand in hand – clean technique not only is more effective but also safer. Whether it’s tapping out, breakfalling, or executing a move with correct form, the advice is to ingrain these habits early. They keep you on the mat, which in the long run means more learning and success. • • • 51 7 \n\nDiscipline-Specific Strategies and Advice While the core principles of grappling apply broadly, each discipline – wrestling, judo, and BJJ – has unique emphases and traditional wisdom. Below, we outline advice particular to each sport , noting how coaching is tailored to the rules and typical scenarios of that discipline. Wrestling Stance and Movement: In wrestling, everything starts from a good stance . Coaches will spend significant time drilling wrestlers to stay in a low, balanced stance with knees bent, back straight, head up, and hands ready. A solid stance is your first line of defense – it makes you harder to take down and ready to sprawl or shoot. Footwork drills (like shadow wrestling and stance-motion drills) ingrain the habit of staying in stance while moving. Wrestlers are taught to move their feet constantly, creating angles and setups. Unlike judo/BJJ that begin standing but often go to ground, wrestling is continuously contested on the feet for takedowns, so superior footwork and stance can dominate a match. A common coaching cue: “Level change!” – reminding wrestlers to lower their hips when closing distance to avoid getting caught upright. Attacks and Chain Wrestling: Wrestling is very offense-oriented – you score by taking down or pinning the opponent – so athletes are encouraged to “shoot your shot” and not be passive. One strategy is chain wrestling : linking techniques in combination. For example, an outside single-leg attempt might transition to a double-leg if the opponent sprawls, then to a body lock if they defend that – never giving them a pause. Coaches develop drills for these sequences so that wrestlers react to defenses automatically with the next move. An old adage: “ Finish your shots” – meaning once you commit to a takedown, keep driving and switch off to other finishes until the opponent is on the mat. Top wrestlers constantly pressure their opponents, forcing reactions and capitalizing. They also dictate ties (grip/clinch positions): whether it’s an underhook, two-on-one (Russian tie), or head control, wrestlers fight to get their preferred tie and deny the opponent’s tie. A piece of advice from a high-school coach encapsulates this: “Dictate the position, dictate the scoring, dictate the match. Focus on what you do well, then go do it.” In practical terms, if you have a great single-leg, you work to get that single-leg grip and attempt it over and over, instead of playing in the opponent’s strongest position. Wrestlers also learn setups – using hand-fighting, head snaps, fakes, and footwork to create openings for shots. The mantra “set it up!” is yelled often in practice, reminding athletes not to shoot blindly but to make the opponent move or react first. Defense and Scrambles: On the flip side, wrestling has a wealth of defensive skills. Sprawling is fundamental – dropping hips to the mat and sprawling legs back when someone shoots – to counter takedowns. Wrestlers drill sprawls repeatedly so it becomes reflex. They’re also taught to “down block” (block with hands) and control an opponent’s arms and head to prevent clean shots. When a shot does penetrate, wrestlers engage in scrambles – improvised positions where both are fighting for control (e.g., whizzer and leg control situations). A common piece of advice is to “keep wrestling” through positions – meaning, don’t stop until the referee whistles. Many reversals or defensive scores happen because one wrestler relaxed too soon. For instance, if taken down, a wrestler might immediately roll into a peterson (reversal) or a granby roll to escape – turning defense into offense. Mental toughness in these moments is key; coaches simulate scramble scenarios in practice to develop this never-give-up attitude. Another specific tactic: whizzer and hip- • • • 8 \n\nheist – if someone gets in on your leg, you might whizzer (overhook their arm with pressure) and hip-heist to create a stalemate or counter. These techniques are staples of wrestling defense. Mat Wrestling (Top and Bottom): Unique to wrestling (compared to judo/BJJ) is the referee’s position and the focus on turns and escapes . When on top position , wrestlers aim to pin or earn near-fall points by turning an opponent’s back toward the mat. Coaching for top position includes rides like spiral ride , tight waist and chops, and pinning combinations (half nelsons, arm bars, cradles). A good top wrestler can break the opponent down flat and methodically work for a pin. Advice for top: “Keep your weight on them, wear them out, and be a step ahead.” That means anticipating escape attempts and re-breaking them down. On bottom position , the primary objective is to escape or reverse . Wrestlers practice explosive stand-ups, hip heists, switches, and rolls to get out from bottom. One classic coaching line: “Wrestle smart from bottom – first move, best move.” The bottom wrestler should explode as soon as the whistle blows, because that initial moment is the best chance to escape before the top applies a ride. Hand-fighting is drilled here too: clearing the opponent’s grips on your wrists/ankles is key to standing up. Wrestlers are taught to never rest belly-down ; they must keep working to improve position, since in folkstyle wrestling if you stall on bottom you can get penalized. Conditioning and Pace: As touched on earlier, wrestling matches are short (often 3 periods totaling 6–7 minutes in folkstyle, shorter in freestyle/Greco) but very intense. Coaches instill the mindset of wrestling at a high pace – breaking the opponent’s will through pressure. Dan Gable was notorious for his Iowa team’s conditioning; the idea was that Iowa wrestlers would outlast and overwhelm opponents in period 3. A well-known Gable quote: “I always liked to train so that my opponent, when he knew he was wrestling me, he knew he was going to get tired.” Pushing the pace also can force mistakes – a tired opponent is likely to give up a sloppy shot or ease on defense, which opens scoring opportunities. So wrestlers often try to “grind down” the opponent with constant snaps, ties, and half-shots to sap their energy. Coaches measure success not just by points scored, but by observing whether their wrestler is controlling the tempo of the match. Being aggressive (but smart) is usually rewarded under wrestling rules (e.g., the more passive wrestler can get hit with a stalling penalty). Therefore, wrestling advice often centers on work rate : “Hands moving, feet moving – make him react to you.” Of course, pacing oneself is also a skill – spurts of all-out effort should be timed tactically (for instance, a last 30-second push). But generally, wrestlers err on the side of offensive output . This is a bit different from BJJ, where a more patient strategy can succeed; in wrestling, if you don’t score, your opponent will. Mindset and Toughness: Wrestling has a very rich culture of mental toughness and discipline. Practitioners often say wrestling is as much mental as physical. Athletes are pushed through grueling practices – not just to build cardio, but to forge a mindset that “nothing in a match will be harder than what I’ve done in practice.” Common mental advice: “Never quit on a position – fight until the finish.” We see this in the way wrestlers will bridge desperately to avoid a pin or keep fighting off their back as seconds tick down. There’s a pride in enduring discomfort (like cutting weight or fighting through fatigue). At the same time, there’s increasing awareness of smart training – that it’s not only about grind, but about confidence and focus. Olympic champion John Smith’s philosophy was extremely technical, emphasizing slick technique and believing that excellence breeds confidence. So modern coaching balances the old-school hard-nose approach with positive mindset techniques. One example: many wrestling teams do visualization and positive self-talk drills (though perhaps not as openly discussed as in other sports). Still, wrestling room quotes often read, “Once • • • 9 \n\nyou’ve wrestled, everything else in life is easy.” – highlighting that the sport’s challenges prepare you for anything . Camaraderie and team support are also emphasized in scholastic wrestling; teammates push each other and hold each other accountable. Rule-Specific Tactics: Each style of wrestling (folkstyle vs freestyle vs Greco-Roman) has some specific tactics. In American folkstyle (collegiate/high school), riding time, escapes, and near-fall count, so strategies like riding an opponent to accumulate riding time or intentionally releasing an opponent to go for another takedown (the “takedown game”) are coached. In freestyle, exposure is key, so gut-wrench and leg lace turns are drilled for top, and avoiding exposure (rolling to stomach instead of back when thrown) is taught for defense. In Greco, upper-body throws and hand-fighting are the focus (since no leg attacks are allowed). But going deep here may be beyond scope – suffice to say, a coach tailors training to the competition ruleset. For example, a U.S. collegiate coach will have his athletes practice mat returns (lifting and returning a standing bottom wrestler to the mat), whereas a freestyle coach will practice par terre defense (resisting gut-wrench turnovers) and not worry about mat returns. An awareness of the scoring nuances – like how many points a particular throw or exposure is worth, or how passivity is called – factors into advanced strategy. In summary, wrestling-specific advice centers on aggression, excellent takedowns, solid defense, and unparalleled conditioning . Wrestlers learn to impose their will : from the tie-ups they want, to the relentless pace, to dominating on top. They also pay special attention to weight management and peaking for competitions (often a season culminating in a championship). Wrestling’s mantra could be “Hard work and technique conquers all.” A combination of grind and finesse, as encapsulated by the balance of being the best technician, in the best shape, with the biggest heart . Judo Grip Fighting (Kumi-Kata): One of the first things a judoka learns is that grips can decide matches . Unlike wrestling (where you grab the body) or no-gi grappling, judo involves gripping the opponent’s jacket (gi), and whoever dominates grips largely dictates the fight’s flow. Grip fighting drills are a daily staple in judo training. Students practice securing their preferred grip (e.g., a strong sleeve and lapel grip, or an over-the-back grip) while preventing opponents from getting theirs. Coaches often allocate specific randori rounds to grip-fighting only – no throws, just fighting for grips. Olympic medalist and coach Jimmy Pedro is well-known for his systematic approach to grips, and many advise studying his methods . A common piece of judo advice: “Win the grip, win the throw.” For beginners, it might be overwhelming, so coaches suggest focusing on basic grip control – such as establishing a standard lapel-and-sleeve grip – before attempting throws. One Reddit judoka advised a BJJ crossover athlete: “Grips change the dynamic a lot. Look up grip fighting… it’s a good start.” . Good gripping involves posture too: keeping your elbows in, using your grip to off-balance the opponent, and breaking their grips on you. Judoka learn techniques like sleeve stripping, cross- gripping to break an opponent’s hold, and moving immediately after gripping (since grips are only as good as what you do with them). High-level judo becomes almost a chess match of grip exchanges – hence the emphasis at all levels on this foundational skill. Kazushi (Off-balancing) and Throws: Judo’s core is throwing techniques, but a successful throw requires kazushi – unbalancing your opponent. Coaches drill judoka to create kazushi through pulls, pushes, and body movement. For instance, before throwing with ippon seoi-nage (shoulder throw), one might tug the sleeve forward and upward, pulling the opponent onto their toes. Beginners often 52 • 20 • 53 54 • 10 \n\nstruggle by trying throws without setup; hence instructors constantly emphasize “set your opponent up.” One practical drill is to have uke (the partner) just resist statically while tori (the thrower) figures out how to make them step or lean – teaching that you can’t throw a stable partner without first breaking that stability. A sage judo saying: “Kuzushi, Tsukuri, Kake” – off-balance, entry, execution. This reminds judoka that a throw is a three-part process, with off-balancing first. As mentioned earlier, a Reddit coach suggested an exercise: attach to a similar-sized partner and “try to move him all over the mat just by moving yourself while connected” , without muscling . This exercise ingrains how to use body movement and connection to off-balance someone – essentially teaching finesse over brute force in throws. When it comes to execution of throws , coaches highlight rotation and commitment . For many throws (like hip throws or foot sweeps), you have to fit in fully and commit your hips or sweep decisively once you feel the opponent’s weight is shifted. Half-hearted attempts often fail or get countered. Thus, “when you go, go .” Judoka practice entries ( uchikomi ) repetitively to develop speed and timing for that moment of commitment. Combination throwing is another tactic: if one throw is resisted, immediately transition to another that takes advantage of the opponent’s reaction (e.g., attempt osoto-gari, opponent leans back, transition to kouchi-gari inside). Coaches will teach common combinations and encourage fluid thinking rather than insisting on one throw against resistance. Transition to Newaza (Groundwork): Although judo is primarily focused on standing throws, groundwork (newaza) is also scored (pins or submissions). However, referees in judo give limited time on the ground; you typically have only a few seconds to show progress or you’ll be stood up. Therefore, judo groundwork strategy is quick and decisive . A judo coach will advise practicing rapid transitions: the moment you throw or get thrown and it goes to ground, immediately flow into a pin or submission attempt. For example, off a throw that doesn’t score ippon, a judoka might instantly go into a hold-down (osaekomi) like Kesa-gatame (scarf hold). In training, judoka do drills where they throw and follow through into a pin, or start in common ground positions (like turtle, since many thrown opponents end up turtled) and work to flip and pin them. Pins (holding an opponent on their back) can win a match if maintained ~20 seconds, so controlling positions like side control (yoko- shiho-gatame) and mount (tate-shiho-gatame) is drilled. Submissions (armlocks and chokes) are taught too – notably the armbar (juji-gatame) from various positions and the clock choke or lapel chokes on a turtled opponent. But because of the short ground time, judo advice is often to focus on getting a quick submission setup or securing a tight pin immediately. If something doesn’t latch on in a few seconds, referees might stand you up. Consequently, judoka are trained to be explosive and assertive in newaza – the opposite of the more patient BJJ style. An anecdotal piece of advice: “Don’t play guard in judo – use newaza only to finish what your throw started.” There are exceptions (some players specialize in groundwork), but by and large, judo strategy prioritizes stand-up and uses groundwork opportunistically. Rules and Tactical Shifts: Judo’s rules have changed over time (e.g., leg grabs were banned in 2010), and tactics shift accordingly. Current judo advice includes avoiding penalties : grip fighting too defensively or refusing to attack can earn shido penalties. Coaches emphasize activity – even if you’re ahead, you must grip and attack to some degree to avoid penalties. Tactically, if leading, a judoka might grip more defensively and attack with low-risk throws to burn time, but they can’t outright stall. Another rule nuance: golden score (overtime) – conditioning matters since matches can go long if no score; judoka train mental focus to not make a mistake in golden score due to fatigue. Also, judoka must be aware of scoring : an ippon (full point) ends the match, waza-ari (half point) are accumulated. Thus, if you’ve scored one waza-ari, you might tactically go a bit more 49 • • 11 \n\nconservative to protect the lead (since two waza-ari equal a win). Conversely, if behind, you know you need to push for a big score. Coaches simulate these scenarios in training – e.g., one student is “down by waza-ari” and has 30 seconds to throw, the other tries to defend smartly without getting penalized. Edge play : Using or avoiding the edge of the mat is also a tactic (stepping out can incur penalties now). Good awareness of mat space is taught – e.g., if being thrown, savvy players might try to escape off the mat to negate a score, though rules penalize obvious escaping. All these finer points mean judo athletes must train not just technique but situational strategy . Training Intensity and Randori: Judo randori (sparring) tends to be high-intensity, akin to stand-up wrestling with throws. The old-school judo approach involves a lot of hard randori to toughen athletes and improve timing. Coaches often advise training with partners of varying styles : fight the fast, lighter guys to work on speed and defense against tomoe-nage (sacrifice throws), fight the heavy, strong guys to work on grip strength and big throws, etc. This mirrors the saying, “If you want to be a lion, train with lions.” Grappling communities often mention that to improve, you should seek out partners who challenge you – this applies equally in judo . Because judo involves impact (throws to the ground), a practical tip is to take care of your body – e.g., learn proper breakfalls (as mentioned) and do conditioning to handle the strains. Judoka often have strong cores and necks from bridging and breakfalling, and coaches include exercises like neck bridges, tumbling, and balance drills to support this. Unique Judo Conditioning: Judo players incorporate conditioning that mimics throwing. Interval- style training such as uchikomi intervals (e.g., 30 seconds as many fit-ins as possible, 30 sec rest, repeat) builds specific endurance. Grip endurance is huge: exercises like towel pull-ups or timed hangs from the gi are common to simulate tired grips in a match. Some coaches have athletes do circuits that alternate throws with push-ups or rope climbs – reflecting the upper-body endurance judo demands. Explosive power in the legs and hips is developed with plyometrics (box jumps, etc.) because a throw is an explosive hip extension. Flexibility drills, particularly for high kicks (for throws like uchi-mata) or deep squats (seoi-nage), are also in judoka routines. So while general athletic advice covers a lot, judo-specific conditioning zeroes in on grip, explosive throws, and the ability to repeat efforts with short recovery (since a match might have many exchanges). In essence, judo-specific advice centers on grip and throw . Win the grips, set up the throw, commit fully, and follow through to the pin or submission. Maintain composure under the pressure of the clock and penalties, and use superior technique and timing to send your opponent airborne. Judo has a saying: “Force your opponent to make the first move – if it is a poor one, capitalize; if it is a good one, have a counter ready.” Thus, combination and counter throws are taught. Finally, judoka are reminded to cultivate a strong spirit – much like wrestling, judo can be very demanding, and the student must learn to push past discomfort (whether grip fatigue or the sting of being thrown hard). The bowing and respect culture in judo reinforce humility: you get thrown, you get back up and continue. That resilience is key to progress in judo’s steep learning curve. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) Positional Hierarchy and Guard: BJJ is unique in that fighting off your back (guard) is an integral part of the art. A core strategic concept is the positional hierarchy – generally: back mount (with hooks) is most dominant, then mount, then side control, then half guard, then guard (which can be neutral or defensive depending on skill), with inferior positions being those where your opponent is • 55 • • 12 \n\ncontrolling you (e.g., you are mounted or they have your back). Coaching in BJJ places heavy emphasis on advancing position and guard work . Beginners are often told to “get comfortable in guard” – both playing guard (attacking from bottom) and passing guard (from top). For new students, one key piece of advice is to focus on escapes from bad positions (mount, back, side control) before trying fancy submissions. As the saying goes, “A black belt is a white belt who has escaped mount thousands of times.” In practice, if you cannot survive when someone mounts you, it won’t matter that you know five armbar setups. Thus, BJJ coaches teach escapes (upa escape and elbow-knee escape from mount, shrimping from side control, etc.) very early. Renowned instructor Saulo Ribeiro in Jiu-Jitsu University even outlines that white belts should prioritize survival and escapes. Community advice echoes this: “Learn to defend and regain guard first, then attacks will come.” By building a solid defense, you gain confidence rolling with anyone. Simultaneously, learning an effective guard is crucial. The guard is often called the “foundation of BJJ.” Beginners typically start with the closed guard (legs wrapped around opponent). They learn attacks like the cross collar choke or armbar from closed guard, but more fundamentally, they learn to break an opponent’s posture and control them from guard. Only with posture broken can one attack or sweep. In modern BJJ, there are many guard types (open guards like De La Riva, half guard, etc.), but a common coaching approach is to give a student one or two guard styles to focus on that fit their body and game. For instance, a flexible person might develop a good closed guard and triangle , whereas a shorter stocky person might prefer half-guard sweeps . The overarching advice is to have a guard you can rely on – a way to prevent passes and initiate offense from bottom. On the flip side, passing guard (getting around the opponent’s legs) is considered one of the hardest skills. Coaches stress fundamentals here: a stable posture when in someone’s guard, good base (balancing weight to not get swept), and strategic pressure. Classic passes like the knee-cut, smash pass, or toreando are taught early, as they instill principles of guard passing (either going through, under, or around the legs). Positionally, the top player aims to progress : pass the guard -> secure side control -> maybe go to mount -> then take back or submit along the way. The bottom player aims to either submit from guard or sweep (reverse positions) to get on top. In sport BJJ, a sweep gives points and is often a gateway to passes. So a lot of BJJ advice is about connecting positions : e.g., use a sweep to come on top directly into a guard pass, or if you mount and they roll, transition to taking the back. This fluid positional game is drilled via specific sparring (e.g., guard passing drills where you switch after a pass or sweep). Relaxation and Breathing: A distinctive piece of advice in BJJ, frequently mentioned on forums and by coaches, is “relax and breathe.” Beginners tend to grapple with excessive tension – every muscle flexed, burning energy quickly. Experienced grapplers appear more relaxed, only exploding when necessary. Staying calm and conserving energy is highly valued in BJJ’s longer rounds (commonly 5- minute plus in sparring, up to 10 minutes in competition for higher belts). One reason is that an adrenaline dump or sudden exhaustion can lead to mistakes and getting caught. So instructors remind students to control their breathing – for instance, exhale when escaping tight positions to avoid panic, or take slow breaths when in a static position like closed guard. A typical scenario: a newcomer holds their breath while trying to escape mount, quickly gassing out. A coach would advise them to take small breaths, stay calm under pressure , and methodically work the escape. There’s even a saying, “Flow with the go,” encouraging a relaxed responsiveness rather than stiff resistance. Being relaxed also helps you feel the opponent’s intentions (sense their weight shifts) and react more fluidly. Many BJJ schools incorporate drills where one person goes light and fluid to encourage relaxation. Additionally, by staying loose, you can transition faster – tension often slows movement. An example of this principle is when playing guard: if you over-grip and tense up, a • 13 \n\npasser can feel it and redirect your force; but a relaxed guard player can quickly switch grips or hip movement as the situation changes. Experienced grapplers might even appear to be resting momentarily in certain positions to recover while the opponent struggles. Learning where you can safely rest (e.g., in your closed guard or when you have someone’s back with a body triangle) is part of BJJ strategy. In short, energy management is a skill: use strength in bursts when needed (e.g., a decisive bridge escape or a submission finish), but not continuously. One Reddit thread of advice to newbies had a top comment: “roll with your partner, not against them” – meaning don’t treat every roll like life-or-death struggle, instead treat it as a learning exchange. This mindset fosters relaxation and better technical growth. “Tap Early, Tap Often”: Safety in training is a point of emphasis in BJJ culture. Because BJJ allows dangerous joint locks and chokes, the understanding is that training partners rely on each other to tap out or release in time. Beginners especially get the advice “There’s no shame in tapping” – it’s how you learn. If you refuse to tap and get injured, you might be out for weeks (or worse). Thus, new students are told to drop the ego: “If you’re caught, tap and reset.” Tapping early (before a joint lock is fully extended or a choke is fully sunk) prevents injury. This also psychologically helps one progress – you learn to experiment without fear, knowing you can tap if it fails. Moreover, every tap is a lesson; you figure out what mistake led to getting caught. Higher belts often share that they too tapped countless times to get where they are. In some gyms, it’s joked that “your goal as a white belt is to tap 1000 times – after that, you’ll be a blue belt.” The corollary advice for the person applying submissions is control and care . Cranking submissions as fast as possible is frowned upon. For joint locks like armbars or heel hooks, applying pressure slowly and controlled gives the opponent a chance to tap (especially in training – competition might differ). For chokes, one can apply gradually; chokes can come on fast, but since they’re generally safe (they cause a tap or someone goes unconscious but not permanent injury if released), people may apply them more assertively than joint locks. Nonetheless, even with chokes, if your partner isn’t tapping but you feel it’s sunk, you might ease to check (some newbies don’t know when to tap). Communication is key – another piece of advice: “communicate with your training partners.” If something hurts or if you’re caught, tap visibly and maybe verbally. Training is cooperative to an extent – you’re not opponents in the gym, you’re teammates. This cooperative mindset is strongly ingrained in BJJ, partly because many practitioners train well into their 40s, 50s, and want longevity. One practical tip is “Tap before it hurts, not after.” That slight ego check prevents countless injuries. Asking Questions and Learning: BJJ gyms often foster an open learning environment. Students are encouraged to ask questions about techniques they don’t understand or situations they encounter . A good coach will explain details or troubleshoot why a move isn’t working. This is a bit different from some traditional martial arts where questioning was less common – in BJJ, problem-solving and experimentation are part of the culture (likely due to its sportive nature). A common beginner mistake is to stay quiet and confused – instead, seniors advise: “If you keep getting caught in something, ask the person or a coach how to defend it.” The community is generally very willing to share knowledge. Likewise, studying outside of class (watching instructionals, matches, YouTube videos) is common in modern BJJ. Coaches might give study recommendations or at higher levels expect students to take ownership of learning specific positions. However, with the deluge of online techniques, another advice is to focus : don’t try to implement 10 new moves at once; incorporate one thing at a time into your game. So a coach might say, “This month, focus on escaping side control and maybe add one guard sweep to your arsenal.” This structured, focused approach prevents overwhelm. • 51 • 56 14 \n\nDeveloping a Game Plan: As students advance, they’re encouraged to play to their strengths and develop a personal game. BJJ is very individual – different body types and attributes lend themselves to different styles (e.g., a tall lanky person might excel at triangle chokes and a variety of open guards, whereas a shorter heavy person might favor pressure passing and mount attacks). A purple belt and above often has a “A-game” sequence: for example, pull guard -> get a De La Riva hook -> berimbolo to back -> finish with a choke, or alternatively, takedown -> pass guard -> collar choke from mount. Coaches help students discover and refine these sequences . In competition, having a game plan is vital: know whether you want to start standing or pull guard, have a combo of techniques you’re best at, and have counters ready for common defenses. One BJJ black belt’s advice to competitors: “impose your game – don’t play your opponent’s game.” That means if you’re a top player, aggressively pursue the takedown and passing instead of accepting guard, and vice versa. Because BJJ offers many guard types and positions, part of game planning is also deciding what not to do – e.g., if you’re not a flexible inverted guard player, maybe avoid positions like inverted guard or deep half that could entangle you. In training, this translates to specific sparring in your target positions to sharpen them. For instance, if your plan is armdrag to back take, you’ll drill armdrags and rolling back-takes extensively. Higher-level advice also covers studying opponents (if known) and analyzing one’s own past matches for mistakes – though at local levels, BJJ folks usually focus on their own game development rather than opponent-specific prep. Competition Mindset and Rules: BJJ competition has its own strategies. One is points awareness – knowing the IBJJF (or relevant org) point scoring and advantages. Competitors are coached to secure points when possible (e.g., after a sweep, stabilize 3 seconds to get the points before moving on) and to not give up points cheaply (e.g., fight grips and pulls to not concede a takedown). If up on points near the end, strategic stalling (while appearing busy to avoid stalling calls) sometimes happens – though too much stalling gets penalized. A common piece of competition advice: “If you’re down on points, you must chase the finish.” Many matches see someone down on points desperately hunting a submission in the final minute – because points alone can’t be caught up without a sweep or pass, etc. Thus, understanding the scenario (am I down 2 points? tied but losing an advantage? etc.) is important. Coaches often shout instructions related to this (“You’re up by 2, keep the position!” or “You need a sweep, 30 seconds!”). Preparing for this, some instructors run practice matches in the gym with points and refs to simulate the pressure. Additionally, tournament day advice includes warm-up properly , stay hydrated, and manage adrenaline. BJJ athletes often practice breathing and visualization (discussed earlier) before matches to stay calm. Many treat the first match as the hardest due to nerves; once that’s done, they find a flow. Self-Defense vs Sport Perspective: Depending on the gym, some advice might be tailored to self- defense application of BJJ (since BJJ has roots in vale tudo and street fighting). For example, keeping your head safe from strikes, using punches in ground and pound – these are not sport concerns but self-defense ones. A self-defense focused coach might advise: “On the street, avoid going to the ground if possible; but if you do, get on top.” They’ll emphasize standing techniques and defensive tactics against common attacks. In contrast, a sport-oriented coach may never mention those aspects and focus purely on grappling moves. It’s worth noting the difference – some community debates revolve around “sport BJJ vs self-defense BJJ.” For our purposes, within training advice, just know that gyms can differ in emphasis. But the core grappling advice overlaps significantly (position, technique, leverage hold true in either case). • • • 15 \n\nIn summary, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu advice highlights technical finesse, patience, and strategic thinking on the ground. BJJ is often called “the gentle art” because ideally a smaller person uses it to negate size advantages of an opponent through superior technique. Key pointers are to maintain positional control , use leverage , conserve energy , and stay mindful during rolls. BJJ’s learning journey is long (often 10+ years to black belt), so coaches remind students to enjoy the process – “embrace the grind and the joy of small improvements.” Practical community tips like “keep a training diary,” “drill that sweep until it’s second nature,” and “don’t compare yourself to others, just be better than yesterday,” all feed into a healthy progression. BJJ’s culture of mutual respect (e.g., bowing or handshakes, calling higher belts “professor” or by first name respectfully) and camaraderie means that much advice also involves helping each other – e.g., higher belts often take time to teach beginners, and beginners are encouraged to ask them (which also flatters the higher belts and reinforces their knowledge). The result is a community where learning is continuous and collective, which is one of BJJ’s strengths as a martial art and sport. Mental and Tactical Preparation (Mindset, Strategy, Competition Psychology) Goal Setting and a Growth Mindset: Mental preparation in grappling starts long before stepping on the mat for competition. Athletes are encouraged to set clear goals – both short-term (e.g., improve a specific skill, win a local tournament) and long-term (e.g., earning a black belt, becoming a national champion) . Having concrete goals gives direction to training and helps motivation. Coaches often work with athletes to ensure goals are realistic and focused on improvement rather than just outcomes. For instance, “execute 3 solid takedown attempts each match” is a process goal within the athlete’s control, whereas “win gold” is outcome-oriented. A systematic review on BJJ noted that competitive level didn’t necessarily change aerobic fitness, implying that progress comes from technical and experiential growth as much as raw physical changes – a reminder that consistent effort and learning lead to improvement. Maintaining a training journal is a widely suggested practice (in BJJ particularly) to track what you learned, note rolling feedback, and ensure you’re progressing . This ties into a growth mindset: viewing every training and competition as a learning experience. A common mental reframing is to treat losses or taps as lessons – instead of feeling defeatist, ask “what did I do wrong? how can I improve?” Athletes who adopt this mindset remain more resilient and motivated. They focus on personal development (e.g., improving their weakness in guard passing) rather than just comparing themselves to others or chasing external validation. This mindset was evident in community advice like, “The belt color isn’t the goal; the goal is getting better – the belt is just a recognition of that” . In wrestling, similarly, coaches instill that each match, even a loss, is experience in the bank – e.g., wrestling many matches in the off-season to gain mat time. Curiosity and willingness to learn are encouraged: ask why a technique works, seek feedback, and be open to new ideas. Notably, advanced grapplers remain students of the game – they might attend seminars, study footage, and continue refining basics. This eternal learner attitude keeps one’s mind engaged and prevents stagnation. Mental Toughness and Resilience: Grappling sports are tough – you will be physically and mentally tested. Mental toughness refers to staying composed, determined, and confident under pressure. Sports psychology research in combat sports suggests that mentally tough athletes experience lower levels of competitive anxiety and higher self-confidence before matches . In practical terms, a wrestler with mental toughness will not break when down on points or when fatigued; a judoka will continue attacking in golden score despite exhaustion; a BJJ fighter will stay calm even in • 57 58 15 59 57 58 • 60 16 \n\na bad position, believing they can escape. Coaches build mental toughness through challenging training – pushing athletes beyond their comfort zones so that they learn they’re capable of more than they thought. For example, wrestling practice might include intense sparring after fatigue sets in (teaching athletes to wrestle tired). A saying, “Train hard, fight easy,” implies that if you’ve endured hell in the practice room, the actual match feels manageable. However, mental toughness isn’t just macho aggression – it’s also emotional control and focus . A study on judo highlighted the importance of confidence and emotional control at elite levels . Being able to manage frustration (e.g., when an opponent counters your best move) and instantly refocus on the next plan is a trait of champions. Athletes use various techniques to cultivate this: some do self-talk , repeating affirmations like “I’ve been here, I’m prepared” to stay confident. Others use pressure simulation , e.g., rolling with a fresh partner every minute (shark tank) to induce mental stress and learning to cope. In competition, a mentally tough grappler is the one who, as Dan Gable’s quote suggests, wins the “third period” with heart – meaning when skill and conditioning are equal, sheer will and refusal to quit makes the difference. That “heart” is essentially resilience: maybe you’re down on points or getting dominated early, but you don’t mentally give up – you stay in the fight and look for opportunities to turn it around. Countless comeback stories in grappling come from athletes who kept their composure and will. One practical piece of advice is not fearing failure . In training, tapping or getting thrown is normal – mentally tough athletes don’t see it as humiliation, but as part of the process. In competition, fearing a loss can make you fight timidly, so coaches encourage embracing the challenge and being willing to risk bold moves to win. “Play to win, not just to not lose,” as they say. Building that mindset can involve competition simulations, or even frequent competition entry to desensitize the athlete to the nerves of big events. Over time, facing these stresses routinely makes them less intimidating. Visualization and Mental Rehearsal: Many athletes use visualization techniques as part of mental prep. This involves vividly imagining scenarios – from the ideal performance to potential difficulties – and seeing oneself succeed. Grapplers might visualize executing their game plan: a judoka visualizes gripping and throwing ippon, a wrestler sees themselves getting the takedown and having their hand raised, a BJJ fighter imagines securing the submission. Visualization can also cover how to deal with adversity: for example, picture being taken down and behind on points, then mounting a comeback. This practice builds a sense of familiarity and confidence. As one BJJ coach noted, mental visualization of techniques and handling challenges with calm can enhance performance . Indeed, scientific research supports that mental imagery can improve motor performance and reduce anxiety. Before competitions, some athletes find a quiet space and run through these mental movies. An added element is sensory detail – e.g., imagining the feel of the grips, the sound of the crowd or ref, the fatigue in the legs, and then imagining pushing through it. This helps prevent sensory overload during the actual event. Another mental practice is meditation or mindfulness . This trains one to stay present and let go of distracting thoughts. A number of fighters (especially in MMA/BJJ) swear by mindfulness meditation to improve focus. For instance, Ryan Loder, a wrestler-turned-MMA fighter, mentioned adding meditation and journaling to his routine to enhance present-moment focus . Mindfulness can help grapplers avoid the trap of worrying about “what if I lose” or ruminating on past mistakes mid-match. Instead, they learn to quickly refocus on the immediate task (e.g., “hand fight for that underhook now”). Breathing exercises are commonly taught as well: taking slow, deep breaths to control physiological arousal. Before a judo match, you might see players bounce to stay warm but also take a couple deep breaths to steady their nerves. Combat athletes often talk about achieving a “flow state” – a mental state of energized focus and immersion 61 62 20 • 63 64 65 17 \n\nwhere action and awareness merge. Practices like visualization and mindfulness increase the likelihood of entering flow under pressure by reducing anxiety and enhancing concentration. Competition Strategy and Game Planning: Tactics can vary by discipline due to different rules, but some universal strategic advice applies. “Fight your fight” is a phrase across all sports: implement your game plan rather than reacting to the opponent’s game. This might mean aggressively pursuing a takedown if you’re a wrestler, or guard-pulling immediately if you’re a BJJ guard expert. Knowing the rules is step one – a BJJ competitor must know how advantages work, a judoka must know what grips or leg grabs are illegal, a wrestler must know how passivity is called, etc. Understanding the scoring allows smart strategic decisions. For example, a judoka ahead by a waza- ari will know to perhaps avoid risky moves that could get them counter-thrown for an ippon. A wrestler in freestyle who leads will know giving up a step-out (1 point) is better than exposing their back (2 points) so they might intentionally step out when in danger. These are nuanced choices that come from rules knowledge. Time management is another tactical element. Grapplers are taught to be aware of the clock and match situation. For instance, if time is running out and you’re behind, you may need to go high-risk, high-reward (e.g., attempt a submission or big throw even if it might fail). Conversely, if you’re winning, you might manage the clock – not stalling blatantly, but perhaps slowing the pace, tying the opponent up, or staying in a safe position. BJJ coaches, for example, might advise a student up on points to maintain top control and not give space for a scramble in the final minute. Wrestling coaches might yell at a winning wrestler to “circle, circle!” to avoid engaging in a risky position in the last seconds. Adapting mid-match : A prepared athlete has Plan A, but also Plan B or C if things go awry. Mike Tyson’s famous quote, “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face,” adapted to grappling could be “...until they get exhausted or their favorite move fails.” A well-rounded grappler can switch strategy – for example, if you can’t take down a judo opponent, perhaps pull guard (if allowed) or focus on counter-throws instead. If your armbar isn’t working on this BJJ opponent, switch to a sweep and try a choke from top. This adaptability comes from training a broad skill set and sparring lots of different styles. Coaches sometimes intentionally put athletes in bad situations in training – e.g., start rounds with you in a choke or armbar – to train the ability to stay calm and escape. That way, if it happens in competition, you don’t panic and you execute your escape (muscle memory + mental composure). Cornering and listening: In competition, grapplers often have coaches yelling advice from the side. A good competitor learns to tune in to their coach’s voice and follow instructions when appropriate. This is a mental skill of its own – not getting so tunnel-visioned that you can’t heed a crucial tip (“30 seconds left! You need to pass guard now!” or “watch out for his triangle!”). Practicing this during training (having coaches or teammates shout pointers) can help. Composure and Emotional Control: Staying emotionally composed is critical. Emotions like anger, frustration, or panic can lead to errors. A frustrated wrestler might shoot recklessly and get countered; an angered judoka might telegraph a big throw and get sidestepped. BJJ, being slower, can breed frustration if you’re stuck in someone’s guard – but panic can make you open to sweeps or submissions. Thus, a lot of mental training is about emotional regulation . One study noted elite judoka benefit from emotional control in performance . Techniques to control emotions include deep breathing (already mentioned), positive self-talk (“Stay cool, I’ve been here”), or using a routine to reset (some smack their face lightly, or do a quick adjustment of gi or headgear – small • • 61 66 18 \n\nrituals to gather themselves). A tip often given is “If you get caught in a bad spot, don’t panic – methodically work your defense.” This is drilled by positional sparring: e.g., escape side control drills teach you to follow steps rather than thrash about (which only wastes energy and could worsen the position). Another emotional aspect is confidence vs. anxiety . Pre-fight nerves are normal – even world champions say they feel butterflies. The goal isn’t to eliminate nerves but to manage them. Some coaches have athletes do a consistent warm-up routine at tournaments to get in the zone – familiarity breeds calm. They might listen to certain music, do specific drills, etc., as a form of “activation ritual.” Grapplers also often remind each other that “the other guy is human too” to reduce intimidation. In judo or wrestling, facing a big name can psyche you out; good coaches will downplay that and focus the athlete on their own strengths and tactics. Sportsmanship and mindset: Interestingly, research found grapplers with more sportsmanlike attitudes (respect for rules and opponents) sometimes reported higher anxiety . This could be because they put pressure on themselves to uphold certain standards. The takeaway for mental prep is perhaps a balance: care about winning and doing things right, but don’t let the weight of expectations cripple you. Some athletes use perspective: remembering that you do this sport for fun or personal growth can relieve the do-or-die feeling. As Renzo Gracie famously said about BJJ, “In the end, it’s just a roll on the mat – enjoy it.” A relaxed yet focused mindset often leads to best performance. Support Systems and Coaching : Behind every grappler is usually a team – coaches, training partners, maybe family – forming a support system. Mentally, knowing you have people in your corner boosts confidence. Dan Gable highlighted the importance of surroundings: “My advice to young wrestlers is that your surroundings really make a difference. Put yourself in good, positive surroundings.” . This means training with people who push you but also believe in you. Grapplers are advised to choose training partners and coaches wisely – ones who encourage growth (and not those who, say, injure you or demoralize you constantly). In the gym, higher belts mentor lower belts, creating a culture where everyone improves. Taking advantage of that – asking questions, getting feedback – was mentioned earlier and is part of mental preparedness (intellectual humility to ask for help leads to improvement). On the flip side, helping others can also reinforce your own knowledge and confidence. Ryan Loder noted that coaching younger wrestlers in his gym not only gave back to the community but also improved his own game and confidence going into fights . The adage “the more you give, the more you receive” holds – teaching a technique clarifies it in your own mind. Additionally, in terms of mental health, a supportive environment is crucial. Combat sports can be intense, and athletes sometimes struggle with the psychological strain (cutting weight, constant competition, etc.). Modern coaching encourages discussing mental health openly – seeking professional help if needed, using sports psychologists, etc. Loder’s emphasis on removing stigma for mental health in fighters is a sign of changing times . The mentally strongest athletes are often those who take care of their overall well- being – balancing intense training with proper rest, hobbies, and support from friends/family to avoid burnout. Adaptability and Analysis: After competitions, strong-minded athletes and coaches will analyze performance rationally. Win or lose, they look at what can be improved. This iterative approach – plan, execute, review, adjust – is a tactical mental skill. It prevents plateauing because you’re always learning from experience. A BJJ competitor might note they struggled with opponents pulling guard 60 67 • 68 69 69 65 • 19 \n\nand plan to work more passing. A wrestler might realize their underhook series wasn’t effective against left-handed stance opponents and seek new setups. Being honest in self-assessment (without being too negative) is key. That’s why journaling or video review is advised: the data doesn’t lie, and you can pinpoint issues. In summary, mental and tactical preparation for grappling sports blends sports psychology, smart game- planning, and the cultivation of a resilient, focused mindset. Common themes include: Confidence through preparation: knowing you’ve done the work so you can trust yourself in competition . Calm under fire: using breathing, visualization, and experience to stay composed and think clearly during a match . Adaptive strategy: being prepared but flexible, ready to seize opportunity or adjust if things go awry. Relentless yet controlled aggression: especially in wrestling and judo – impose your will but don’t lose technical control or awareness. Love of the game: perhaps the most important mental aspect. The best grapplers often simply love grappling – this passion carries them through brutal trainings and tough losses. Maintaining that sense of fun or at least deep satisfaction in the grind is crucial for longevity and success. As many say, “Enjoy the journey” . A grappler who is curious and enjoys learning will, in the long run, outlast and outperform those who only grit their teeth through misery. By prioritizing both physical preparation and mental training , grappling athletes can develop the full package: technique, athleticism, and the mindset of a champion. Each discipline might phrase the advice differently – an old judo master might speak of calm zen mind, a wrestling coach might talk of hard work and heart – but they all point to the fusion of skill and will. With high-quality training, smart coaching, and the collective wisdom of the community, today’s grapplers are improving faster and achieving more than ever, all while honoring timeless principles of combat. The key is to take this advice, apply it earnestly, and remain a student of the art throughout your journey. With that approach, excellence in grappling – be it wrestling, judo, or BJJ – becomes an attainable and rewarding goal. Sources: Andreato et al. (2017).
