## Development Notes

### Current Implementation
- **Frontend**: React component with Material-UI interface
- **Backend**: Express.js server with multer and pdf-parse
- **File Handling**: In-memory processing (no files saved to disk)
- **Article Storage**: Currently logs to console (extensible for database/file storage)

### Future Enhancements
1. **Article Storage**: Save articles to database or file system
2. **Article Management**: List, edit, and delete created articles
3. **Multiple Formats**: Support for other document formats
4. **Rich Text**: Support for formatting and images
5. **Article Categories**: Organize articles by topic or type
6. **Search Functionality**: Search within created articles

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Only PDF files are allowed"**
   - Ensure you're selecting a PDF file
   - Check that the file has a `.pdf` extension

2. **"File too large"**
   - PDF files must be under 10MB
   - Consider compressing the PDF or splitting it

3. **"Failed to extract PDF text"**
   - The PDF might be password-protected
   - The PDF might be corrupted
   - Try with a different PDF file

4. **"Network error"**
   - Ensure the backend server is running on port 3001
   - Check that the frontend can reach `http://localhost:3001`

### Debug Information
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages
- Check the server console for backend error logs
- The DevMode interface includes debug information for troubleshooting

## Security Considerations

- **File Upload Validation**: Only PDF files are accepted
- **File Size Limits**: 10MB maximum to prevent abuse
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Files are processed in memory only
- **Error Information**: Limited error details to prevent information leakage

## Performance Notes

- **Memory Usage**: PDFs are processed in memory (consider large files)
- **Processing Time**: Depends on PDF size and complexity
- **Network Transfer**: Files are uploaded to the server for processing
- **Text Cleaning**: Automatic cleanup improves readability

## Integration with Existing Features

The PDF Article Creator integrates seamlessly with:
- **DevMode Interface**: Part of the existing development tools
- **Navigation System**: Articles can be accessed via the Articles button
- **Error Handling**: Uses the existing snackbar notification system
- **State Management**: Follows the existing React patterns

This feature provides a powerful way to convert PDF content into web-readable articles while maintaining the ultra-lightweight, minimalist design philosophy of the BJJ Skill Matrix application.
