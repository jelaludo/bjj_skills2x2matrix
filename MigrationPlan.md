# Material-UI Migration Plan for Grappling Primitives

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step migration of the BJJ Skill Matrix app from custom CSS to Material-UI (MUI) for improved responsiveness and mobile experience.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Components Structure
- **App.tsx**: Main application with state management

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **D3 Integration Complexity**: D3 may not work well with MUI's responsive containers
   - **Mitigation**: Test early, consider alternative charting libraries if needed

2. **Bundle Size Increase**: MUI adds significant bundle size
   - **Mitigation**: Use tree-shaking, code splitting, and lazy loading

3. **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn MUI patterns
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple components, gradually increase complexity

4. **Custom Styling Conflicts**: Existing custom styles may conflict with MUI
   - **Mitigation**: Remove conflicting styles, use MUI's styling system

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: 1-2 days
- **Phase 2 (Layout)**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 3 (Components)**: 3-4 days
- **Phase 4 (Mobile)**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 5 (Testing)**: 1-2 days

**Total estimated time**: 9-14 days

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this migration plan
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin with Step 1 (Installation)
4. Test each step thoroughly before proceeding
5. Document any deviations from the plan
